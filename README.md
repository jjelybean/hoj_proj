# 📂 Record keeping System

Tired of playing hide-and-seek with your files? 🕵️‍♂️

Meet this Record Keeping System! This web app lets you find records instantly and manage them effortlessly, so you spend less time searching and more time doing what actually matters.   

Designed with _**React & Bootstrap,** _ powered by a **Node.js + MySQL backend**__, and first hosted locally in our office—this is our take on making record hunting a little less boring.

Built during our internship term (April–May 2025), this app was proudly hosted locally in at the Office of the City Prosecutor at the Hall of Justice. While the project is fully functional, we see it as a work-in-progress canvas where new ideas can still be painted in.


## 🚀 Features That Matter

- 🔍 **Smart Search** – Quickly find the record you want to view in just seconds.
- ➕ **Add on the Fly** – Keep the archive growing with just a few clicks.
- ✏️ **Edit Records** - Modify records to keep them up to date.
